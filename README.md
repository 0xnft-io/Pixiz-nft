# Pixiz NFT Project

The God of Pixiz has created 10000 unique Pixiz on the Ethereum Blockchain.
Every Pixiz is a winner.
Like all living things even Pixiz must pass away.
Once the sale has completed the contract will:
- automatically reward the dev address & creator address with 30% of the contract balance
- leaving 70% of Ether raised during the sale in the contract
We have removed the withdraw functionality.
Only holders of Pixiz will reap the contract rewards.
Every hour one Pixiz must... DIE!
The owner of the dead Pixiz receives a death rebate. A value proportionally determined by the Ether balance in the contract.
IE. Each Pixiz death the rebate would be contract-balance / totalSupply()

But wait, there's more!
After your Pixiz dies you will receive a PixizDust NFT. These Pixiz have passed
on and taken a new form in their afterlife.

Mint a Pixiz for 0.025 ETH. Mint up to 20 Pixiz at a time.
Sale begins in September.
